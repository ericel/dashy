# Dashy-app Udacity Dashboard Project

Corporate dashboard application using angular front-end MVC framework.

A geospatial view, identifying the number of employees at various company locations.

A “key metrics” view, containing components displaying: the number of open issues, a line chart reflecting number of paying customers over a period of time, and a bar chart reflecting number of reported issues over a period of time.

A “data view” of all issues, with an appearance similar to a spreadsheet, that is sortable and filterable.
